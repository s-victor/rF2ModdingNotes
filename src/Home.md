# rF2 Modding Notes

This wiki/repo contains a collection of my modding notes written for rFactor 2, most of which were originally posted on [rF2 official forum](https://forum.studio-397.com/index.php?threads/my-modding-notes-using-opensource-free-software.70938/).

Most of notes here utilized opensource and free software.

Have fun modding.
